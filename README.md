# wp-github-activity
Display GitHub activity in your WordPress site in a fancy way.

## Thoughts
Either make another plugin for the Repo activity webhook, or rename this one to something like 'wp-github-repo-activity'.
This depends on if the plugin uses Webhooks, or the REST API.

The plugin could just use Webhooks and require the user to link each repo to the plugin. <- Find a way to automate this.

19APR: It should be possible to send information about User activity via a GitHub App or via a OAuth App connection to a User's profile.

## Plans
- 'Status'-Block
- 'Current Activity'-block
- 'Past Activity'-block
- 'Specific Period Activity'-block
- 'Live'-block
- 'Live'-toasts

And many more
